Make sure you have the following files in your directory, in order to run the pioneer example:

1. vrep.py
2. vrepConst.py
3. 
the appropriate remote API library: "remoteApi.dll" (Windows), "remoteApi.dylib" (Mac) or "remoteApi.so" (Linux)
4. pioneer.krb
5. pioneer.py


The first three are in the V-REP remoteApiBindings directory... most likely:
C:\Program Files (x86)\V-REP3\V-REP_PRO_EDU\programming\remoteApiBindings\lib


The fourth and fifth file are provided in the Lab1.zip
